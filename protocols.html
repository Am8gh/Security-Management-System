        <h2>How We Ensure Security</h2>
        <p>Our system follows stringent protocols to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with industry standards. Here are the key security protocols we implement:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Data Encryption</h3>
        <p>All sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using advanced encryption standards (AES) to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>

        <h3>2. Access Control</h3>
        <p>We implement strict access control measures, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data and critical system components through role-based access control (RBAC).</p>

        <h3>3. Incident Response Plan</h3>
        <p>Our comprehensive incident response plan outlines procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents, minimizing the impact on operations.</p>

        <h3>4. Regular Security Audits</h3>
        <p>We conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential weaknesses in our systems, ensuring ongoing compliance with security standards.</p>

        <h3>5. Security Awareness Training</h3>
        <p>We provide ongoing security awareness training for all employees, educating them on best practices for cybersecurity and the importance of adhering to security policies.</p>

        <h3>6. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
        <p>We enforce multi-factor authentication to enhance security for user accounts, adding an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.</p>

        <h3>7. Network Security</h3>
        <p>Our network security measures include firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and regular monitoring to detect and mitigate threats in real-time.</p>

        <h3>8. Compliance with Regulations</h3>
        <p>We ensure compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001, implementing necessary controls and documentation to meet legal requirements.</p>
